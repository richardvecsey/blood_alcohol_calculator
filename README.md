# blood_alcohol_calculator
**Easy BAC (blood alcohol content) calculator with Widmark factor** <br>
The goal of this program is to show the BAC calculation method with Widmark factor. Be careful, this is not a real alcohol-meter. If you want to know your exact BAC, buy an alcohol-sensor. However, there are different rules in different countries about drinking and driving, please DO NOT DRIVE if you have drunk alcohol.<br>
After a party walk, call a cab, an Uber or use the public transport.
